Talk to Things Around You
=========================

<p>Talk to Things Around You is a workshop at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2014/" target="_blank">NYU's ITP camp 2014</a> that explores possibilities of Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) in our lives. BLE technology allows us to set up iBeacons so we can listen and broadcast real time proximity based information. We will focus on setting up high quality user experiences based on these new capabilities.</p>
